<p>Hello there! I am Sushma Ghimire, a recent undergraduate  from Kathmandu University, Nepal. I have been an active OSM contributor ever since I joined Kathmandu Living Labs in July 2020 as a Geospatial Analyst Intern. Prior to joining KLL, I knew very little about OSM: to me it was open and mapping platform and produces freely available digital maps. As I started contributing more, I came to know about its uses and significant impacts all around the world. I learnt that even a small rectangular polygon mapped in OSM, can symbolize buildings and people living in it, and consequently draw the attention of decision makers.</p>

<p>The journey from being a beginner to advanced mapper and OSM data validator has made me thoughtful of many little things that I had no idea about. My initial days in mapping was the remotely based armchair mapping and preparing the foundational/base features of maps like buildings and roads in eastern Nepal, mainly Province 2 with an objective to prepare it for disaster and develop resilience in the province. These spatial datasets were expected to help the frontline workers and first responders reach the affected areas post-disaster and prioritize aid. I learnt that these datasets could also be useful for government teams to identify where vulnerable populations are and provide them with a way to track and visualize risks. I was really amazed knowing that my small contribution from the chair had such a high level impact in  places that I have never physically been to, directly touching the lives of people who I had never met. Additionally, I also contributed to OSM as a local mapper and mapped my own street. I could easily identify the type of buildings, amenities, roads and other several features on the map in my own area and fill in the details for these underlying base features. As such, I was directly contributing to my own area too for a social and humanitarian cause and it is something one can really boost about and be proud of.</p>

<p>What I like about OSM is the fact that anyone can map in OSM. Anyone can contribute both to places where they live and or places they have never been.</p>
