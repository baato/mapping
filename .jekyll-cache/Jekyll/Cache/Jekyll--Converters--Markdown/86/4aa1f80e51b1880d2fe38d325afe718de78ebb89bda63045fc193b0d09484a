<p>Hello there! I am Sushma Ghimire, a recent undergraduate  from Kathmandu University, Nepal. I have been an active OSM contributor ever since I joined Kathmandu Living Labs in July 2020 as a Geospatial Analyst Intern . Prior to this, I knew very little about OSM, that it is an open and mapping platform and produces freely available digital maps. As I started my contribution in OSM, I came to know about its uses and significant impacts all around the world. Even a small rectangular polygon mapped in OSM, can identify every person residing in that building, and consequently draw the attention of decision makers for them.</p>

<p>The journey from being a beginner to advanced mapper and OSM data validator has made me thoughtful of many little things that I had no idea about. My initial days in mapping was the remotely based armchair mapping and preparing the foundational/base features of maps like buildings and roads in eastern Nepal, majorly Province 2 with an objective to prepare it for disaster and develop resilience in the province. These spatial datasets were expected to help the frontline workers and first responders to reach the affected areas post-disaster and prioritize aid. These datasets could also be useful  for government teams to identify where vulnerable populations are and provide them with a way to track and visualize the risks. I was really amazed knowing that my small contribution from the chair had such a high level impact in the places where I have never been to and directly affected the life of people whom I have never met. Additionally, I also contributed to OSM as a local mapper and mapped my own street. I could easily identify the type of buildings, amenities, roads and other several features on the map in my own area and fill in the details for these underlying base features. As such, I was directly contributing to my own area too for a social and humanitarian cause and it is something one can really boost about and be proud of.</p>

<p>Not only me, anyone can map in OSM. Anyone can contribute to the place where they live in and even to the places they have never been. OSM is such an amazing and powerful tool and mapping platform having global coverage.</p>
